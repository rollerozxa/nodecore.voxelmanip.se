<p>Below is the full source code for the NodeCore engine fork, as required by the LGPLv2.1 license to provide the source code of forks. It is provided as-is, with all the source code included that made the binary build available on Google Play.</p>

<p>By the way, the NodeCore engine fork is based off of <a href="https://rollertest.voxelmanip.se/">ROllertest</a>. Also see the <a href="https://wiki.voxelmanip.se/wiki/Distributing_Minetest_Games">Distributing Minetest Games</a> page on the Voxelmanip Wiki if you'd want some details on how to distribute Minetest games independently using an engine fork.</p>
